      <p>The Commonplace membership takes the rigour of the Commonplace blog and doubles down on a focus to action.</p>

      <p>You’ll get access to: </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Action Sheets</strong> — summarised actionable items from Commonplace blog posts. Just the basic principles that you can refer to when you’re about to put the ideas to practice. (<a href='https://commoncog.com/blog/commonplace-action-sheets/'>More about Action Sheets here &rarr;</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Members-only blog posts and guides</strong> — you’ll get access to <a href='{{@site.url}}/guides/'>Commonplace Guides</a> — constantly updated actionable handbooks on core topics like career moats, learning science, and avoiding burnout. These guides will be updated as I uncover new research, or conclude new experiments. You’ll also gain access to <a href='{{@site.url}}/members/'>member-only posts</a>, which I intend to write once a month.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to a Community of Practice</strong> — access to a <a href="https://forum.commoncog.com/">private community</a> that is focused on practice, not discussion. Once a week, every week, we share our experiments and our goals, and then report back on how we did on those experiments. Commonplace blog comments are also limited to members.</li>
        <li><strong>Early access and discounts on the Commoncog app</strong> — Members get early-access to the <a href='https://commoncog.com'>Commoncog app</a>, and a special discount when it reaches general availability.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you find the blog posts on Commonplace valuable, you’ll love what I’ve planned for members. </p>

      <p>Your subscription allows me to keep producing Commonplace. It also gives me the freedom to build Commoncog.</p>
      <p>On the writing end of things, it allows me to go deep on topics that might be useful to members. And it allows me to keep producing the free posts that you know and love.</p>

      <h2 class='offer__header'>About Commonplace</h2>
      <hr/>
       <p>Commonplace is built around a single idea: <strong>today, job security is the ability to get your next job, not keep your current one.</strong></p>

      <p>The way you go about doing that is to focus on <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/career-moats-101/">career moats</a>: that is, building competitive advantages that ensure you don’t have to worry about finding your next job. Much of my writing is focused on understanding <em>what</em> career moats are, and <em>how</em> to get better at building them.</p>

      <p>Career moats are primarily <a href='https://commoncog.com/blog/a-personal-history-of-the-career-moat/'>how I think about my career</a>. Over the past few years, I've mapped out most of the nuances of building career moats from scratch. I've done this by writing from synthesis and practice. And I do this because I believe that having a career moat is an amazing thing.</p>

      <h3 class='offer__header'>If you have a career moat, you aren’t as worried about finding work. </h3>

      <p>You know that if you are ever laid off, you may easily find another job, because you possess ‘career capital’ — skills and resources that are relatively rare, and are in sufficient demand to guarantee enough money to support you and yours.</p>

      <p>This knowledge gives you peace of mind. </p>

      <p>It allows you to think more strategically about your career, and it allows you to plan your moves ahead of time. </p>

      <p>But all of this reading is only useful up to a certain point. How do you build a career moat?</p>

      <p>The answer is simple: you do it through action.</p>

      <p>The Commonplace Membership Program is designed to help you do just that.</p>
